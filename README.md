OBJECTIVES:
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze an online retail store dataset. Here are several questions that will be answered in this analysis:
1.	What is the total amount of revenue generated?
2.	What products do consumers buy most?
3.	Which product is the most expensive?
4.	Which product has the highest total sales?
5.	Which countries do most customers come from?
6.	How many products were canceled?

TOOLS:
I use Python 3.12 as my primary data tool for the processes of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Excel.

DATA PREPARATION:
In the data preparation section, I will prepare the data so that the data is clean and can be analyzed properly in the next section. The following is the Python code that I used to do the data preparation.

*Import openpyxl as pd
This library uploads Excel in Python 3.12

After adding the libraries, the next step is to call the dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
