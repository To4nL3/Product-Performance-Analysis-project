# THE DATA:

The data is an Excel file downloaded from Kaggle.com, a data center with many datasets worldwide. This dataset uses the years from December 1, 2009, to December 9, 2011.

It contains 2 Excel sheets of 2 different years, “2009-2010 and “2010-2011” with 9 columns
and 525462 rows in year 2009-2010 sheet and 9 columns and 541911 rows in year 2010-2011 sheet. Below is an image of the columns and their descriptions.

## OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze an online retail store dataset. Here are several questions that will be answered in this analysis:
1.	What is the total amount of revenue generated?
2.	What products do consumers buy most?
3.	Which product is the most expensive?
4.	Which product has the highest total sales?
5.	Which countries do most customers come from?
6.	How many products were canceled?

## TOOLS

I use Python 3.12 as my primary data tool for the processes of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in Excel.

DATA PREPARATION:
In the data preparation section, I will prepare the data so that the data is clean and can be analyzed properly in the next section. The following is the Python code that I used to do the data preparation.

*Import openpyxl as pd
This library uploads Excel in Python 3.12

After adding the libraries, the next step is to call the dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

Here are some of the data from my dataset:

## DATA CLEANING

To work with the data I did the Data cleaning first as this is an important part in data analysis. In this way, we will be able to understand if the data seen is ready to be analyzed or not. If not, then cleaning can be done. Cleaning can be done by removing outliers, empty values, and duplicate data.

Handle missing data: First, I would look at the amount of missing data in each column.

> dataset.isnull().sum()

The above data code gives the columns whose data is missing, the Description column and Customer ID. And to delete rows with missing data, I used the following code:

> delete rows with missing data dataset1 = dataset.dropna()

## ANALYSIS
1.	What is the total amount of revenue generated?

To check and analyze data, Python removed the total revenue generated by adding the sum formula in an Excel file for both sheets, Years 2009-2010 and Years 2010-2011.

2.	Total No. of Customers acquired.

The total no. of unique customer was taken out by customer ID column and adding unique customer ID function in the formula for python to check and analyze data. As per the data total number of unique customers are 5942.

3.	Which is the bestselling product?
 
The best-selling product based on the stock code and quantity of product sold in both years by ignoring negative values and expenses.

4.	Country with the highest sales of Product:
   
The UK stands out as the country with the highest number of transactions, totaling 902,5222. This data suggests an opportunity for online retailers to consider increasing their production and marketing efforts within the UK market. However, it's important not to solely focus on the UK; attention should also be
given to countries with lower transaction volumes. Inbound marketing, targeted advertising, and exploring international markets can effectively expand sales abroad.
